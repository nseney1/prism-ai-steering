# Known Issues — Windows (v0.89.0)

Open Windows issues as of v0.89.0 were observed on Windows 11 with Windows PowerShell 5.1, Git Bash, and Python 3.14. Each open issue is tracked in [`BUG_REGISTRY.json`](project/BUG_REGISTRY.json) with `"status": "open"`.

> **⚠ On v0.89.0, don't run the full test suite on a Windows machine you care about (BUG-010).** It can write to the real home directory. That includes `tests/test_install_lifecycle.py`, which `enzymes/verify_readme_claims.py` may invoke. Fixed after v0.89.0; see below.

## Fixed after v0.89.0 (unreleased)

### BUG-035: Cell inventory rejected edited cells ([#61](https://github.com/nseney1/Soma-Governance/issues/61))
On v0.89.0, `soma_scan` and `soma_list_cells` fail with `file changed before it was opened`, and `soma_request_receipt` returns `Internal error`, so no write or execute tool can run. Cause: `os.stat` and `os.fstat` report different `st_ctime` values on Windows. The inventory now leaves `st_ctime` out of its change check on Windows and reads cells in binary mode.

### BUG-036: `uninstall.sh` under Git Bash rejected every path ([#62](https://github.com/nseney1/Soma-Governance/issues/62))
Under Git Bash the removal plan holds MSYS paths (`/c/Users/...`, `/tmp/...`), and the confinement check runs in native Windows Python, where `os.path.isabs()` rejects them, so on v0.89.0 uninstall refuses every entry and removes nothing. The check now maps MSYS paths with `cygpath` (resolved from `PATH` by the shell, never from the current directory), and the manifest reader writes UTF-8 with LF line endings, so manifests with several entries per field and non-ASCII names are removed in full. On Windows the check also refuses path segments that end in a space or a dot, and `:` stream syntax.

### BUG-038: Enzyme scripts crashed on a cp1252 stdout ([#65](https://github.com/nseney1/Soma-Governance/issues/65))
On v0.89.0, standalone scripts under `enzymes/` and `immune_system/verification/` print non-ASCII characters and exit 1 with `UnicodeEncodeError` when stdout is cp1252 (redirected or captured output, including hook runs). **Workaround on v0.89.0:** `$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = "utf-8"` (PowerShell) or `export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` (Git Bash). All 29 entry points with non-ASCII output now replace characters the console can't encode.

### BUG-010: Test suite wrote to the real home directory ([#47](https://github.com/nseney1/Soma-Governance/issues/47))
Under Git Bash, `resolve_home()` prefers `USERPROFILE` over `HOME`, and six calls in `tests/test_install_lifecycle.py` overrode only `HOME`, so the installer ran against the real profile. The shared `run()` helper in `tests/conftest.py` now sets `USERPROFILE` whenever a test overrides `HOME` alone.

### BUG-012: Implicit cp1252 encoding ([#49](https://github.com/nseney1/Soma-Governance/issues/49))
On v0.89.0, `soma status` exits 1 with `UnicodeEncodeError` when stdout is cp1252 (for example, redirected output). **Workaround on v0.89.0:** `$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = "utf-8"`. `soma` and `enzymes/verify_bug_registry.py` now replace characters the console can't encode. Cell listing already reads UTF-8 explicitly since v0.89.0.

### BUG-013: Windows-only test failures ([#50](https://github.com/nseney1/Soma-Governance/issues/50))
The tests embedded unescaped Windows paths in generated files, compared paths as POSIX strings, wrote CRLF where bytes mattered, hard-coded `/bin/bash`, and required symlink privileges. They now escape paths, compare normalized paths, write LF, resolve bash (or skip), and skip symlink and execute-bit checks Windows can't satisfy. CI does not yet run the test suite on Windows ([#56](https://github.com/nseney1/Soma-Governance/issues/56)).

## Fixed in v0.89.0

### BUG-008: MCP server crashed at startup ([#45](https://github.com/nseney1/Soma-Governance/issues/45))
`soma_mcp/tools.py` and `soma_sdk/telemetry.py` now guard the POSIX-only `fcntl` import and use platform-appropriate or best-effort locking fallbacks.

### BUG-009: Write/execute MCP tools needed a token hosts could not supply ([#46](https://github.com/nseney1/Soma-Governance/issues/46))
Write and execute tools now use single-use receipts obtained from `soma_request_receipt`. A receipt is bound to the MCP session, canonical workspace, operation, exact arguments, target-file state, and governance-cell state. It is an operation authorization mechanism, not user authentication.

### BUG-011: `install.ps1` did not parse under Windows PowerShell 5.1 ([#48](https://github.com/nseney1/Soma-Governance/issues/48))
The PowerShell scripts now carry a UTF-8 BOM, and CI dry-runs the installer under Windows PowerShell 5.1 as well as PowerShell 7. This fixes parsing, not the separate rule-content decoding problem in BUG-014.

## Open issues

### BUG-037: Git Bash `python3` may be the Windows Store stub ([#64](https://github.com/nseney1/Soma-Governance/issues/64))
A python.org install may not provide `python3.exe`, so `python3` resolves to the App Installer stub. `command -v python3` succeeds but execution fails, preventing hook generation and other shell-script Python calls.

**Workaround:** disable the `python3.exe` App execution alias and put a real `python3` on `PATH`, such as a shim that invokes `python.exe`.

### BUG-032: PowerShell installer does not install lifecycle hooks
`install.ps1` skips hooks because they require Bash, so post-session fitness updates never run after a native PowerShell install.

**Workaround:** install through Git Bash with `install/install.sh`, with a real `python3` on `PATH` (see BUG-037).

### BUG-014: PowerShell installer writes mojibake ([#59](https://github.com/nseney1/Soma-Governance/issues/59), split from [#48](https://github.com/nseney1/Soma-Governance/issues/48))
Windows PowerShell 5.1 decodes UTF-8 rule files using its locale default when `Get-Content` has no explicit encoding, so generated rules can contain mojibake. The PowerShell installer also skips hooks.

**Workaround:** use `pwsh` to avoid the known PS 5.1 decoding problem, while recognizing that PowerShell installer hook parity is still unavailable.
