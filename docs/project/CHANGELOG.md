# Changelog

All notable changes to Soma are documented here.
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Open bugs BUG-033 and BUG-034** in the Bug Registry: `soma status` miscounts installed core rules (#55), and `mutation_tester` fails open when tests cannot run (#54). Both were reproduced on v0.89.0.
- **Open bugs BUG-036, BUG-037 and BUG-038**: `uninstall.sh` under Git Bash rejects every path (#62), the Git Bash `python3` Store stub (#64, split out of BUG-010), and enzyme scripts crashing on a cp1252 stdout (#65).
- **Open bug BUG-040**: recording an outcome leaves `.soma/evidence/.signals.lock` as an untracked file, because no ignore rule covers it (#70).

### Changed
- **BUG-013 root cause** recorded in the Bug Registry and `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES_WINDOWS.md`: generated verification tests embed unescaped Windows paths and fail with a `unicodeescape` `SyntaxError`.
- **BUG-015** now links to #57, and **BUG-014** to its own issue #59 (split from #48, which the v0.89.0 BOM fix closed). **BUG-032** is listed in `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES_WINDOWS.md`.

### Fixed
- **Windows: cell inventory rejected any cell edited after creation** (BUG-035, #61): `soma_core/cell_inventory.py` compared `os.stat` and `os.fstat` signatures that included `st_ctime_ns`, which Windows reports as creation time from one and change time from the other. `soma_scan` and `soma_list_cells` failed, and `soma_request_receipt` returned `Internal error`, so no write or execute MCP tool could run on Windows. `st_ctime_ns` is now left out of the signature on Windows, and cells are opened with `O_BINARY` so the snapshot holds the exact on-disk bytes. Regression tests: `test_receipt_flow_works_after_cell_edited_since_creation`, `test_cell_edited_after_creation_is_inventoried`. The `O_BINARY` change also fixes `test_inventory_is_stable_and_captures_exact_bytes` on Windows. The stale-receipt tests now match the exact verifier message, because their `"receipt"` substring check also accepted unrelated errors such as the missing-receipt error.
- **Windows: installer tests wrote to the real user profile** (BUG-010, #47): under Git Bash `resolve_home()` prefers `USERPROFILE`, and six `tests/test_install_lifecycle.py` calls overrode only `HOME`. The shared `run()` helper in `tests/conftest.py` now sets `USERPROFILE` to `HOME` when a test overrides `HOME` alone. Regression test: `tests/test_home_isolation.py`.
- **Windows: `soma status` crashed on a cp1252 stdout** (BUG-012, #49): printing an emoji raised `UnicodeEncodeError` and the command exited 1. `soma` and `enzymes/verify_bug_registry.py` now reconfigure stdout with `errors="replace"`; standalone enzyme scripts are still affected (open BUG-038). `tests/test_rule_metadata.py` reads rule files as UTF-8. Regression tests: `tests/test_cli.py::TestNonUtf8Console`, `tests/test_bug_registry.py::test_error_report_survives_cp1252_stdout`.
- **Windows-only test failures** (BUG-013, #50): generated tests now escape `tmp_path` (`{str(tmp_path)!r}`); path assertions compare `Path.parts` or normalized paths; byte-sensitive files are written as UTF-8 with LF; `tests/conftest.py` gains `require_bash()` (replacing hard-coded `/bin/bash`) and `symlink_or_skip()`; the execute-bit test skips on Windows. On Windows the suite goes from 49 to 12 failures (BUG-036, BUG-038).
- **`mutation_tester` failed open when tests couldn't run** (BUG-034, #54): `check()` counted any test failure as a killed mutant, so a test file with a syntax error, import error or wrong assertion reported `verdict=True`. It now runs the tests against the unmutated source first and returns `verdict=False` (`lines=[-1]`) when that baseline fails. Regression tests: `tests/test_verification/test_mutation_tester.py::TestMutationTesterFailsClosed`.
- **`mutation_tester` skipped most mutation kinds** (BUG-039, #66): comparison, `and`/`or`, statement-deletion and return-value mutations were counted but never applied, so a test that never checked a comparison reported `verdict=True`. Every collected mutation is now applied; docstring deletion and `return None` are no longer generated, since they are equivalent mutants no test can kill. Regression tests: `tests/test_verification/test_mutation_tester.py::TestMutationTesterAppliesEveryCollectedMutation`.
- **Recording an outcome left `.soma/evidence/.signals.lock` untracked** (BUG-040, #70): `evidence_lock()` keeps its lock file, and no ignore rule covered it, so `git add -A` would commit it. `.soma/evidence/.gitignore` now lists it. Regression tests: `tests/test_telemetry.py::TestEvidenceLockIgnoredByGit`, which also checks that the committed evidence files are still not ignored.
- **Windows: `uninstall.sh` under Git Bash refused every path** (BUG-036, #62): MSYS paths (`/c/...`, `/tmp/...`) reached the confinement check in native Windows Python unconverted, so `os.path.isabs()` rejected them and nothing was removed. The check now maps them with `cygpath`, resolved from `PATH` by the shell, since a bare name in Windows Python also searches the current directory. Three defects behind it are fixed too: `read_manifest_field` wrote CRLF in the console code page, so every entry but the last, and non-ASCII names, silently dropped out of the plan; an entry it couldn't encode (a lone surrogate) ended the list early, and uninstall then exited 0 and deleted the manifest; and a refusal could crash while printing its own path. Hardening: on Windows the check also refuses path segments that end in a space or a dot, and `:` stream syntax, which Win32 would resolve to a different name than the one checked. Regression tests: the Git Bash path-form, Win32-normalisation and manifest-reader tests in `tests/test_uninstall_confinement.py`.
- **Windows: enzyme scripts crashed on a cp1252 stdout** (BUG-038, #65): standalone scripts under `enzymes/` and `immune_system/verification/` printed emoji or other non-ASCII and exited 1 with `UnicodeEncodeError` when output was redirected or captured, including hook runs. All 29 entry points with non-ASCII output now reconfigure stdout with `errors="replace"` at the start of their `__main__` block, the same guard as BUG-012. `tests/test_enzyme_console_encoding.py` covers it, and the 3 Windows failures in `tests/test_crossover_structured.py` are fixed.

## [0.89.0] — 2026-10-02 — "MCP Execution Security"

### Added
- **Opaque, stateful, session-bound receipts for MCP execution** (Fixes BUG-009): The server now requires single-use cryptographic receipts for all write and execute tools, fetched via `soma_request_receipt`. This ensures only trusted MCP connections can mutate workspace state, mitigating cross-workspace CSRF attacks.
- **Strict workspace injection boundaries** in the MCP dispatcher. The server forcibly injects the operator-configured `_canonical_workspace` into write and execute tools, ignoring client-provided `workspace` arguments, preventing path traversal via rogue arguments.
- **Open-bug tracking in the Bug Registry**: entries take `status: open|fixed` (default `fixed` for existing entries). `enzymes/verify_bug_registry.py` requires only the core fields for open bugs, rejects open bugs that set fix fields, and skips regression-test collection for them.
- **`platform_compat` root-cause category** and open bugs BUG-008–BUG-014 (Windows and MCP issues; GitHub issues #45–#50) and BUG-015 (`soma checkpoint`/`soma sync` wipe cell fitness on a fresh clone).
- **`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES_WINDOWS.md`**: open Windows issues, workarounds, and impact.

### Changed
- **README**: known-issue notes for the MCP server and Windows; the Windows rows of the platform table are now ⚠️ where open bugs apply.
- **`soma_request_receipt` classification**: Reclassified from `_WRITE_TOOLS` to `_READ_TOOLS` so it remains discoverable in `tools/list` when execution mode is disabled.

### Fixed
- **MCP write/execute tools unusable from MCP hosts** (BUG-009, #46): Handshake designed for direct clients replaced with session-bound receipt architecture. Regression test: `test_mcp_dispatch.py`.
- **`install.ps1` failed to parse under Windows PowerShell 5.1** (BUG-011, #48): the installers were UTF-8 without a BOM, so PS 5.1 read them as cp1252. They are now saved with a UTF-8 BOM. Regression test: `test_powershell_scripts_with_non_ascii_have_utf8_bom`. CI: new Windows PowerShell 5.1 dry-run step in `validate.yml`.
- **MCP server crashed on Windows at startup** (BUG-008, #45): `soma_mcp/tools.py` and `soma_sdk/telemetry.py` imported `fcntl` unconditionally. Both now fall back to unlocked appends when `fcntl` is unavailable, matching `enzymes/fitness_updater.py`. Regression tests: `tests/test_fcntl_optional.py`.
- `tests/test_diagnose_hot_zones.py`: the "Insufficient data" snapshot test assumed fewer than 10 registry entries; it now asserts the warning tracks the registry size.

### Fixed (pre-release review)
- **Canonical workspace was never injected** (BUG-016): the assignment sat after an unconditional `return`, so write/execute tools honoured a client-supplied `workspace`. The dispatcher now strips server-owned keys (`workspace`, `receipt`, `_sessionToken`) from every call, read tools included, and injects the operator-configured workspace after receipt verification. Privileged calls fail closed when no canonical workspace is configured. Tests: `tests/test_mcp_receipt_binding.py`.
- **Receipts bound to empty digests** (BUG-017): receipts now bind sha256 digests of the target files named in the arguments (`file_path`, `files`, `context_files`) and of every cell under `.soma/cells`, recomputed at redemption. Paths outside the workspace are rejected at issuance. Note: any cell edit (including an outcome-engine fitness update) inside the 300 s receipt window makes outstanding receipts stale; request a new one.
- **Telemetry `event_id` was not enforced** (BUG-018): `append_signal` now holds a cross-process evidence lock (`.soma/evidence/.signals.lock`; `fcntl`, `msvcrt` or thread-lock fallback), treats an identical replay as a no-op, raises `EventConflictError` for a changed payload, returns the persisted record, and stamps every record with the epoch `generation`.
- **Epoch migration was a placeholder** (BUG-019): `run_epoch_migration` now holds the evidence lock for the whole cutover, snapshots every ledger into `snapshot/gen-<n>/` with `SHA256SUMS`, converts legacy `fitness.jsonl`/`outcomes.jsonl` rows with deterministic event ids, skips MCP twins and already-migrated rows, aborts unchanged on a reconciliation mismatch, writes atomically, and fences writers via `append_signal(expected_generation=...)` / `StaleGenerationError`.
- **Human-insight cursor advanced before persistence** (BUG-020): reading no longer writes the cursor. `main()` appends evidence first; insight events carry a stable id, so a retry after a partial failure dedupes instead of duplicating. The cursor is then committed atomically, and cell frontmatter is updated only after that, so a retry never applies a boost twice. Appends are fenced on the generation the run observed. Partial trailing lines are re-read.
- **MCP outcomes could be double counted by migration**: `soma_report_outcome` now writes one `outcome_id` into both the legacy `outcomes.jsonl` row and its idempotent `signals.jsonl` twin, and migration dedupes on that id. Rows without an id fall back to timestamp matching.
- **Uninstall path confinement was lexical** (BUG-021): `uninstall.sh` and `uninstall.ps1` validate every manifest field and the full removal plan against canonical allowed roots before any mutation, fail closed, and re-check each path at the sink. Symlinked or junctioned ancestors are accepted only when their target stays inside the allowed root (stow-style `~/.kiro -> ~/dotfiles/.kiro` works; a link out of `$HOME` is refused). OneDrive placeholders, which carry the ReparsePoint attribute without being links, are not treated as redirections.
- **`quality_gate` crashed on Python 3.14** (BUG-022): dropped the removed `ast.Str` alias.
- **Release could ship untested bytes** (BUG-023): one build records `SHA256SUMS`; the sdist and the matrix-installed wheel are smoke-tested outside the checkout (`python -I`, `PYTHONPATH` unset, module origins asserted under site-packages) by `.github/scripts/wheel_smoke.py`; `publish.yml` verifies the digests and uploads only the verified files.
- **BUG-009 registry entry** used a non-schema `resolved_in` field and lacked `changelog_ref`, so the registry failed its own verifier and broke CI.

## [0.88.2] — 2026-10-01 — "Documentation Updates"

### Documentation
- Removed deprecated API Key fields from `README.md` configuration table.

---

## [0.88.1] — 2026-10-01 — "Credential Hardening"

### Security
- **Deprecated Plaintext API Keys**: Removed `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` from configuration files (`soma.conf`, `.soma/credentials.conf`).
- **Enforced Secure Storage**: `inference_provider.py` now exclusively resolves credentials via environment variables or the system `keyring`, mitigating the risk of accidentally committing secrets.

---

## [0.88.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Key Management"

### Added
- **HMAC-SHA256 key management** (`soma_mcp/integrity.py`): 256-bit key generation, storage in `.soma/keys/manifest.key` with `0o600` permissions, key rotation with `.bak` backup.
- **Manifest signing**: `save_manifest()` auto-signs when key exists; `verify_signature()` uses constant-time `hmac.compare_digest`.
- **`soma_generate_manifest` MCP tool**: Generates and signs cell integrity manifests, with optional key creation. Added to `_EXECUTE_TOOLS` tier (requires session auth).
- **Signature verification in cell cache**: `cell_cache.py` logs HMAC verification status during refresh.
- **10 new security test cases**: Key CRUD, signing determinism, tamper detection, auto-sign on save, graceful unsigned fallback.

### Technical
- Stdlib only (`hmac` + `secrets`), no new dependencies.
- Signs only the `cells` dict (not metadata) for canonical determinism.

---

## [0.87.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Content Cleanup"

### Removed
- **Deleted `soma_run.py`** (221 lines): Legacy master orchestrator, fully replaced by MCP server (`soma_mcp/`) and CLI (`soma_cli/`). Zero importers found in codebase.

### Changed
- **`docs/architecture/scripts.md`**: Marked "Master Pipeline Orchestrator" section as removed, pointing to `soma_mcp/`.
- **`soma_sdk_js/README.md`**: Replaced `soma_run.py` reference with MCP server.

---

## [0.86.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Security Hardening"

### Added
- **Path confinement** (`soma_mcp/security.py` — NEW): `confine_workspace()` rejects workspaces without `.soma/cells/`; `confine_path()` blocks path traversal and symlink escape; `validate_cell_names()` rejects fabricated cell names.
- **Enzyme import allowlist** (`soma_mcp/tools.py`): Frozen allowlist + `_safe_import_enzyme()` prevents rogue `.py` files in `enzymes/` from being loaded.
- **SHA-256 cell integrity manifests** (`soma_mcp/integrity.py` — NEW): Manifest generation and verification during cell cache refresh with graceful degradation.
- **Session token auth** (`soma_mcp/server.py`): Token generated on `initialize`, required for write/execute tools, read tools remain open.
- **Per-tool rate limiting** (`soma_mcp/server.py`): Sliding window rate limits on execution-heavy tools.
- **Permission tiers**: All tools classified into `_READ_TOOLS`, `_WRITE_TOOLS`, `_EXECUTE_TOOLS` frozensets.
- **31 new security test cases** (`tests/test_security.py` — NEW): Path confinement, cell validation, integrity manifests, enzyme allowlist, auth tiers, rate limiting.

### Fixed
- **`tests/test_mcp_verify.py`**: Updated 8 test fixtures to create valid `.soma/cells/` workspaces (required by new confinement checks).

---

## [0.85.1] — 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- **Python 3.9 compatibility** (`enzymes/diagnose_hot_zones.py`): Added `from __future__ import annotations` — `dict | None` union syntax (PEP 604) requires 3.10+ at runtime. (BUG-006)

---

## [0.85.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Antifragile"

### Added
- **Hot Zone Engine** (`soma_sdk/hot_zones.py`): Pure-function module computing file heat and pattern heat from the bug registry. Cells covering historically-buggy files or recurring root cause categories receive a fitness score boost.
- **Configurable thresholds** in `BUG_REGISTRY.json`: `file_heat_threshold` (default 2), `pattern_heat_threshold` (default 3), `max_file_boost` (0.5), `max_pattern_boost` (0.3), `min_outcomes_for_boost` (3).
- 17 new tests in `tests/test_hot_zones.py` — threshold activation, cap enforcement, tag-to-category mapping, workspace integration.

### Changed
- `soma_mcp/jit_engine.py`: `express()` now applies hot zone boost after initial fitness scoring. Multiplicative formula ensures zero-scored cells stay at zero.

### Design
The antifragile loop: Bugs → Registry → Hot zones → Cell boost → Better governance → Fewer bugs → ♻️

---

## [0.84.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Bug Ledger"

### Added
- **Bug Registry** (`docs/project/BUG_REGISTRY.json`): Machine-parseable registry with root cause taxonomy (`path_error`, `schema_drift`, `silent_failure`, `mapping_error`, `dead_code`), severity levels, regression test links, and pattern descriptions. Backfilled with Bugs 1–5.
- **Verification enzyme** (`enzymes/verify_bug_registry.py`): Validates schema, ID uniqueness, root cause categories, and regression test existence.
- **Governance cell**: `trap-unregistered-bug-fix` — gate enforcement requiring BUG_REGISTRY.json entries alongside bug fixes.
- 9 new tests in `tests/test_bug_registry.py` — schema validation, uniqueness, and integration with the real registry.

---

## [0.83.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Fast Path"

### Added
- **JIT Cell Cache** (`soma_mcp/cell_cache.py`): mtime-based in-memory cache eliminates redundant disk I/O when the MCP server calls `express()`. Cells are re-parsed only when files in `.soma/cells/` change.
- 9 new tests in `tests/test_cell_cache.py` — cache hits, invalidation on add/modify/delete, expired cell skipping, schema compatibility.

### Changed
- `soma_mcp/jit_engine.py`: `express()` now uses module-level `CellCache` singleton instead of `load_all_cells()` per invocation.

---

## [0.82.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Consolidation"

### Fixed
- **Bug 4**: `sync.py` no longer clobbers cell scores to 0.0 when a cell has triggers but no tp/fp outcomes. Score is preserved until actual outcome data arrives.
- **Bug 5**: `outcome_engine.py::append_fitness_log()` no longer writes to dead-end `.soma/cells/fitness.jsonl`. Now routes through unified `soma_sdk.telemetry.append_signal()` to `.soma/evidence/signals.jsonl`.
- **Bug 5b**: `cell_selection.sh` lifecycle actions redirected from `.soma/cells/fitness.jsonl` to `.soma/evidence/lifecycle.jsonl`.

### Changed
- **Writer migration**: `fitness_updater.py`, `soma_mcp/tools.py` (soma_report_outcome), and `outcome_engine.py` now write through `soma_sdk.telemetry.append_signal()`.
- **CLI wrapper**: `python3 -m soma_sdk.telemetry` enables bash scripts to write signals through the unified path.
- **ROADMAP.md**: Phase 4 → ✅ Shipped, Phase 4.5 → ✅ Shipped, Phase 4.6 added.
- **README.md**: CI outcome reporter moved from "Planned" to shipped.

### Added
- **Governance cell**: `trap-roadmap-status-drift` — gate enforcement requiring ROADMAP.md updates alongside releases.

---

## [0.81.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Smoke Detector"

### Added
- **CI Outcome Reporter** (Phase 4.5b): `enzymes/ci_outcome_reporter.py` — report-only advisory that matches cells to changed files via `target_paths` globs, computes per-file credit weights (conserved 1/N), and proposes signals (pass→`trigger`, fail→`fp`). Integrated into CI as a GitHub Actions step summary.
- **Unified telemetry writer** (Phase 4.5a): `soma_sdk/telemetry.py` — `append_signal()` with file-locked concurrent writes, schema validation, and canonical evidence log at `.soma/evidence/signals.jsonl`.
- **Governance cell**: `trap-bugfix-without-regression-test` — mechanical enforcement requiring regression tests for every bug fix.
- **TDD test suite**: 4 new test files — `test_telemetry.py` (8), `test_ci_outcome_reporter.py` (10), `test_telemetry_bugfixes.py` (8). Total: 1,518 passed.

### Fixed
- **Bug 1**: `outcome_engine.py` read from wrong path (`.soma/outcomes.jsonl` → `.soma/evidence/outcomes.jsonl`).
- **Bug 2**: `outcome_engine.py` expected wrong schema key (`cells_used` list → also accepts `cell_id` string).
- **Bug 3**: `sync.py` silently ignored agent outcomes (`success`/`failure` now mapped to tp/fp).

---

## [0.80.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Consensus"

### Added
- **Quorum sensing** (Phase 4.1): `evaluate_quorum()` detects when ≥N cells trigger simultaneously on the same changed files, escalates to the highest `minimum_mode`, and logs events to JSONL. Extracted from CLI `main()` for testability.
- **Gate enforcement DSL** (Phase 4.2): `soma_sdk/invariants.py` with `check_import_banned()` (AST-based), `check_file_must_exist()`, `check_invariants()` aggregate, and `evaluate_enforcement()` three-tier ladder.
- **Enforcement ladder**: `advisory` (warn, exit 0) → `mechanical` (block, exit 1) → `gate` (block, exit 1). Unknown tiers default to advisory.
- **TDD test suite**: 3 new test files — `test_quorum.py` (11), `test_gate_invariant_dsl.py` (9), `test_enforcement_ladder.py` (7). Total: 1,492 passed, 7 skipped.

### Fixed
- **Documentation cleanup**: 9 doc files updated — stale version refs, broken post-restructure links, removed claim terminology, outdated phase statuses.
- **Stale release branches**: Deleted 10 local release branches (`release/v0.60` through `release/v0.75`).

### Claims Unlocked
- `claim_quorum_sensing` — Multi-rule consensus for high-confidence decisions
- `claim_gate_enforcement` — Invariant DSL-based gate enforcement in CI

---

## [0.75.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Credit Where Due"

### Added
- **Credit assignment** (Phase 3.1): `prob_round()` probabilistic rounding, `compute_credit_weights()` per-file scope narrowing with credit conservation. Signal provenance tracked in JSONL via `credit_weight` and `signal_method` fields.
- **Mutation operators** (Phase 3.2): Comparison swap (`<`↔`>`, `<=`↔`>=`, `==`↔`!=`), boolean swap (`and`↔`or`), statement deletion (stmt→pass), return value mutation (`return X`→`return None`).
- **TDD test suite**: 8 new behavioral test files — `test_credit_assignment.py` (14), `test_outcome_engine.py` (18), `test_jit_engine_behavioral.py` (22), `test_error_handling.py` (13), `test_mcp_tools_contract.py` (12), `test_tournament_integration.py` (8), `test_crossover_structured.py` (12), `test_mutation_tester_upgraded.py` (10).

### Fixed
- **Crossover target_paths** (Phase 3.6): `cell_crossover.py` now merges `target_paths` as deduplicated union of both parents. Previously omitted entirely, making child cells unable to match any files.
- **Crossover tags**: Tags now merged as union instead of reset to empty list.

### Changed
- `compute_fitness_signals()` accepts optional `changed_files` kwarg for credit weighting.
- `update_cell_fitness()` uses `prob_round(credit_weight)` for tp/fp counter updates.
- `append_fitness_log()` includes `credit_weight` and `signal_method` provenance.
- Claim registry: `claim_credit_assignment`, `claim_structured_crossover`, `claim_tournament_selection` unlocked.

### Metrics
- Test suite: **1465 passed**, 7 skipped, 0 failed (up from 1359 in v0.74)

---

## [0.71.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Branch Sync"

### Fixed
- **Gitflow step 7**: Release checklist now merges **main** back to develop (not the release branch). Previous workflow skipped main's PR merge commit, causing main and develop to diverge over 5 releases.

---

## [0.74.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Foundation"

### Added
- `soma_sdk/errors.py`: Complete error hierarchy (SomaError → CellParseError, CellNotFoundError, CellPathTraversalError, FitnessError)
- `soma_sdk/scoring.py`: Wilson-bounded fitness scoring (bayesian_posterior, laplace_score, _wilson_interval)
- `soma_sdk/cells.py`: Canonical cell parser (parse_cell_file, write_cell_frontmatter, load_cell, _sanitize_cell_id)
- `tests/test_bayesian_correctness.py`: 17 mathematical ground truth tests
- `tests/test_sdk_behavioral.py`: 21 SDK public API tests

### Changed
- Migrated 27 enzyme/CLI files from inline YAML parsing to canonical `parse_cell_file()`
- `CellFitness.bayesian()` upgraded from Wald approximation to Wilson score interval
- `Cell.is_extinct` / `Cell.is_promotable` now use `laplace_score()` import
- `enzymes/bayesian_score.py` converted to thin wrapper re-exporting from `soma_sdk.scoring`
- `enzymes/cell_deps.py` added `--workspace` argument for testability

### Metrics

- Claims: 8 unlocked, 5 locked, 7 removed (20/20 verified)
- Net code change: +1606/-353 lines across 41 files

---

- `enzymes/verify_readme_claims.py`: CI gate verifying README claims against tests
- `tests/test_static_invariants.py::test_version_is_single_sourced`: Version sync invariant
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: Future features moved from README
- `docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md`: Codified gitflow release procedure

### Changed
- README stripped to earned claims only — removed 7 unverified claims
- Fixed `exit 1` bug in pre-commit hook generation (cell_enforce.py)
- Version synced across pyproject.toml and VERSION file

### Removed
- Unearned README claims: evolutionary computation, gate enforcement, < 1.0% waste rate, deterministic verification, inflated test count

---

## [0.70.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Genesis"

### Added
- **`soma genesis` command**: Scans codebase architecture with 8 language-agnostic detectors and generates governance cell candidates.
  - Detectors: module boundaries, config stores, shared state, API surfaces, data pipelines, state machines, test boundaries, dependency walls
  - All generated cells start as vacuoles with `proposed_type` frontmatter
  - Generates `docs/organelles.md` architecture map
  - Flags: `--dry-run`, `--json`, `--force`, `--yes`

### Security
- Path traversal fix: import regex rejects relative imports; `is_relative_to()` containment check
- Memory exhaustion fix: streaming `read(limit)` replaces `read_text()[:limit]`
- Symlink guard: `is_symlink()` check before all file writes

### Fixed
- Dry-run no longer creates `.soma/cells/vacuoles/` directory
- `docs/organelles.md` respects `--dry-run`, `--force`, and symlink guards
- `input()` wrapped in `try/except` for headless environments
- `rglob` replaced with filtered `_iter_source_files` (no `.git`/`.venv` traversal)
- Frontmatter/markdown sanitization prevents injection via crafted identifiers
- 80% I/O reduction via single-pass source cache across 5 detectors

---

### Fixed
- **README.md**: Version badge 0.60.0 → 0.62.2, test badge 1162 → 1228, script count 58 → 57. Added `soma sync` to CLI table. Added PyPI install to Quick Start. Added Python 3.9+ label.
- **QUICKSTART.md**: Added all CLI commands (sync, checkpoint, oracle, promote, demote, doctor, verify). Fixed repo URL. Updated PyPI status from "coming soon" to available. Added PEP 668 hint. Added Kiro platform.
- **SCRIPTS.md**: Full recount and rewrite — 39 → 57 scripts cataloged.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Added Python 3.9 compat requirement, CI matrix info, test command, `from __future__ import annotations` requirement.
- **pyproject.toml**: Added Python 3.9/3.10/3.11/3.12 classifiers.

## [0.62.1] — 2026-10-01 — Patch

### Fixed
- **`make install`**: Handle PEP 668 externally-managed Python environments (`--user --break-system-packages` fallback chain).
- **`make install`**: Print PATH hint when `~/.local/bin` is not on PATH.
- **`install.sh`**: Fix skill install crash when a previously-installed file/symlink is being replaced by a directory (`cp: cannot overwrite non-directory`).

---

## [0.62.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Evidence Pipeline"

### Added
- **`soma sync` command**: Reconciles `.soma/evidence/fitness.jsonl` and `outcomes.jsonl` with cell frontmatter. Supports `--dry-run` and `--json` flags.

### Fixed
- **Fitness pipeline disconnect**: `fitness_updater.py` wrote trigger events to JSONL but never updated cell frontmatter, causing `immune_grade.py` and `cell_fitness.py` to report zero fitness despite evidence existing.
- **`soma checkpoint`** now auto-syncs evidence → frontmatter before running quality checks, so the report card is always fresh.
- **`fitness_updater.py`** now auto-syncs frontmatter after writing JSONL, closing the pipeline gap.

### Changed
- Bootstrapped fitness evidence from two Supercell session transcripts (170+ trigger events, 42 cells scored).

---

## [0.61.0] — 2026-10-01 — "Python 3.9 Compatibility"

### Fixed
- **Python 3.9 runtime crash**: 6 files in `immune_system/verification/` used PEP 604 union syntax (`X | None`) in function signatures without `from __future__ import annotations`, causing `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |` on Python 3.9. Added the future import to all affected files.

### Changed
- **CI matrix**: Added Python 3.9 to test matrix (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows).
- **CI publish**: Auto-publish to PyPI on GitHub release creation via `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret.

---

## [0.60.0] — 2026-09-30 — "Two-Layer Verification & Cell Lifecycle"

### Added
- **Two-Layer Verification System** (`immune_system/verification/`):
  - **Layer 1 (Deterministic AST Tools)**: Objective, ungameable evidence collection via `persistence_checker`, `call_graph`, `mutation_tester`, `branch_coverage`, and `import_guard`. Orchestrated via `runner.py` producing boolean `ToolEvidence`.
  - **Layer 2 (Adversarial Information-Partitioned Agents)**: Multi-agent verification leveraging information asymmetry between Spec Agent (sees task specification) and Code Agent (sees implementation/tests).
  - **Deterministic Arbiter**: Set-algebra adjudication over a fixed 14-category risk taxonomy, issuing `SHIP`, `BLOCK`, or `REVISE` verdicts with zero LLM in the loop.
  - **Transcript Verifier**: Post-hoc validation of self-reported agent claims against JSONL session logs.
- **Unified CLI Suite** (`soma`): 9 subcommands — `init`, `status`, `report`, `doctor`, `verify`, `checkpoint`, `oracle`, `promote`, `demote`.
  - `soma verify`: Full two-layer verification with `--layer1-only` support.
  - `soma checkpoint`: Fast deterministic quality gate with `--pre-commit` hook integration.
  - `soma oracle`: Cell health classification (healthy, noisy, expired, unobserved).
  - `soma promote` / `soma demote`: Automated lifecycle evaluation with `--dry-run` and `--json`.
  - `soma init`: Enhanced with `--rules {minimal|standard|full}`, MCP config, and pre-commit hook.
- **Cell Lifecycle Engine** (`immune_system/verification/lifecycle.py`):
  - Deterministic state machine: Vacuole → Wall → Genome (and demotions).
  - Grounded in JSONL evidence ledgers, not YAML frontmatter.
  - Promotion: triggers ≥ 20, tp_rate > 0.85, age > 30 days.
  - Demotion: fp_rate > 0.5 or dormancy ≥ 90 days.
- **MCP Tools**: Added `soma_verify_changes` and `soma_checkpoint` for zero-API-key in-agent verification.
- **Supercell Review Intensity**: New highest review tier (above Tempest) — adversarial Prosecutor/Defender pairs per prong, iterative fix-revalidate with no deferrals until clean ship.
- **Quality Gate Checks**: Assertion density, bare `pass` detection, import verification, test sanity.
- **Doc Consistency Tests**: 6 tests verifying README ↔ SKILL.md intensity level consistency.
- **Test Suite**: 1184 tests with shared fixtures (`tests/helpers_cell.py`).
- **Governance Cells**: 44 total — 20 walls, 2 plasmodesmata, 3 membranes, 3 chloroplasts, 16 vacuoles.
  - NEW: `trap-stdout-protocol-corruption` (wall) — hooks emitting to stdout after JSON.
  - NEW: `trap-tautological-test` (wall) — tests that verify nothing.
  - NEW: `contract-sdk-feature-parity` (plasmodesmata) — Python/JS SDK method parity.
- **SDK Parity**: Added `entropy()` and `adversarial()` to Python SDK (matching JS SDK).

### Changed
- Package discovery updated to include `immune_system*`.
- Pre-commit hook auto-installed by `soma init`.
- Architecture diagram widened for Supercell intensity level.
- **SDK `is_extinct`/`is_promotable`**: Now use Bayesian scoring aligned with `cell_promote.py` standards (score > 0.85, triggers ≥ 20) instead of legacy `raw_score`.
- **DRY**: `outcome_engine.py` imports canonical `resolve_workspace()` from `soma_resolve.py`. Intentional duplication in `soma_mcp/` documented (zero-dep wall).
- **Type Annotations**: Added to all public APIs in `governance.py`, `cells.py`, `jit_engine.py`, `bayesian_score.py`.
- **Test Fixtures**: Deduplicated `soma_workspace`, `_write_cell`, `_make_cell` into shared `helpers_cell.py`.
- **Hardcoded Paths**: `safety_gate.sh` and `immune_init.sh` now use `${SOMA_LOGS_DIR}` / `${SOMA_CONF}` env vars with fallbacks.
- **Makefile validate**: Now covers `soma_cli/` and `immune_system/` in addition to `enzymes/`, `soma_mcp/`, `soma_sdk/`.
- **Docs**: Fixed ABSTRACT contribution count (3→4), step count (12,000→11,900), removed duplicate PHYLOGENY section, added Phase 16/18/19/20/21 stubs.

### Fixed
- **Evidence Pipeline**: 4 critical bugs fixed (schema mismatch, dead detectors, missing FPSR extraction).
- 2 new evidence detectors: `test-before-implementation`, `no-hardcoded-paths`.
- **Security (Supercell S1)**: Code injection via `.format()` in `branch_coverage.py` — paths now escaped with `repr()`.
- **Security (Supercell S2)**: Path traversal via `--files` — containment check added to `verify.py`.
- **Correctness (Supercell C1)**: Outcomes path/schema desync between MCP and lifecycle engine.
- **Correctness (Supercell C2)**: JSONL crash on non-dict lines in lifecycle evidence loading.
- **Correctness (Supercell C3)**: Lifecycle threshold bugs (boundary values, min sample size, dormancy).
- **Bug**: 5 pre-existing `test_status.py` failures from real filesystem leak through platform auto-detection.
- **Robustness (Phase 2)**: 9 fixes across verification tools:
  - `branch_coverage.py`: Parse `missing_branches`, add subprocess timeout (120s), UTF-8 encoding.
  - `transcript_verifier.py`: FileNotFoundError guard, tool_calls-based write detection (no more content-string false positives), collection error sentinel `(-1,-1)`, multi-run false positive fix.
  - `immune_init.sh`: JSON protocol corruption — 4 echo statements redirected to stderr.
  - `escalation_sentinel.sh`: Frontmatter `target_paths` parsing replaces fragile hypothesis regex.
- **Layer 2 Fail-Open (Phase 3)**: Empty spec agent predictions now produce `Verdict.BLOCK` instead of silently passing through to `SHIP`.
