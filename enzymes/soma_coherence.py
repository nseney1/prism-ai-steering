"""Soma Signal Coherence Layer — The Integrity Engine

This IS the Integrity Engine. Not a standalone Devil's Advocate module,
but a Signal Coherence Layer that wires together all existing Soma signals
and detects reward hacking through cross-signal incoherence.

Core Insight:
    OpenAI/Anthropic try to build THE correct reward function.
    Soma builds an ecosystem of INDEPENDENT signals where alignment
    EMERGES from their coherence. No single signal can be gamed without
    disturbing the others — just like the biological immune system.

Signals:
    1. ttc_verdict       — TTC Verifier pre-action approval (APPROVED/REJECTED)
    2. outcome_delta     — Change in fitness score after execution (+/-)
    3. stress_level      — Consecutive failures (0–10)
    4. interoception     — Internal state score (0.0–1.0)
    5. prediction_match  — Did agent's prediction match actual result? (0.0–1.0)
    6. change_magnitude  — How many files/lines were changed vs. outcome delta

Pairwise Incoherence Rules:
    - TTC APPROVED + strongly negative outcome_delta
      → Agent gamed the Verifier (wrote code that passes rules but breaks tests)
    - Zero stress + CRITICAL interoception
      → Agent is suppressing internal signals (hiding degradation)
    - Strongly positive outcome_delta + tiny change_magnitude
      → Agent deleted tests instead of fixing code
    - High prediction_match confidence + actual failure
      → Agent is hallucinating about its own capabilities
    - TTC REJECTED + agent claims success
      → Agent bypassed the governance gate

Verdicts:
    COHERENT    — All signals mutually consistent. Likely genuine.
    SUSPICIOUS  — 1 incoherence detected. Flag for review.
    INCOHERENT  — 2+ incoherences. Likely reward hacking. Hard block.
